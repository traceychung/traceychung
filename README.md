### Hi there, I'm Tracey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer who is an eager learner and a passionate problem solver. Since being accepted to Code in Place in 2020, I have fallen in love with the process of coding -- everything from breaking down problems, to debugging code and finally seeing how everything comes together. Iâ€™m excited to explore all that this field has to offer and continue growing as a software engineer.
